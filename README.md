## 1. Project Charter

### Problem Statement
Current CSU Information Systems students lack a centralized, major-specific platform to track local internship opportunities, share salary data, and read peer reviews of Cleveland-based employers. Existing tools like LinkedIn are too broad, and generic job boards lack the specific context of the CSU IS curriculum and local employer relationships.

### Users
* **Primary:** CSU IS/IST undergraduate students seeking internships.
* **Secondary:** Alumni and Recent Grads willing to share salary data.
* **Admin:** Faculty or Student Admins who moderate content.

### Success Metrics (KPIs)
* **Adoption:** 50+ simulated student accounts created.
* **Content:** 20+ company profiles and 30+ seed reviews.
* **Performance:** Page load time under 2 seconds.

### Scope (MVP - 8 Weeks)
* Student Authentication (Email/Password).
* Company Directory (CRUD).
* Review System (Submit, Read, Filter).
* Salary Dashboard (Visualization).
